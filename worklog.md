Work Log:
- Built MEKANIX brand design system: graphite + amber industrial palette, Space Grotesk display font, technical grid/dots/glow utilities, dark-first theme with light mode
- Prisma schema: 20+ entities with relations (User, Customer, Technician, Specialty, Certification, ServiceArea, Vehicle, ServiceRequest, Job, Diagnosis, Part, TrackingEvent, Invoice, Payment, Review, Message, Notification, Warranty, ServiceCategory)
- Seed script: 8 technicians (varied specialties/ratings/levels), 5 customers, 10 vehicles/machines (cars, trucks, buses, excavators, loaders, tractors, graders), 14 jobs across all statuses, invoices, payments, reviews, warranties, notifications
- API layer: 20+ route handlers (dashboard, technicians, vehicles, service-requests + assign, jobs + status/diagnosis/parts, invoices, payments, reviews, messages, notifications, admin resources, auth/demo, seed, categories)
- Shared components: premium SVG MapView (swappable for Mapbox/Google), JobStatusTimeline, NotificationCenter (polled), ChatPanel (bidirectional), TechnicianCard, VehicleCard, charts (recharts), StatCard, EmptyState, AdminTable (searchable/sortable/paginated), status/urgency badges, icon resolver
- Customer flow: hero home, fleet management (add/delete), request flow (select machine → describe → match → tech profile → request → tracking), real-time tracking with map+timeline, invoice approve&pay, completion+review+warranty, service history, chat, settings, notifications
- Technician flow: dashboard (online toggle, KPIs), requests (accept/decline), job detail (status advancement REQUESTED→...→COMPLETED, diagnosis, parts CRUD, auto-invoice on WAITING_APPROVAL), earnings (revenue chart + payouts), schedule (calendar + service areas), profile, reviews, chat
- Admin platform: operations overview (7 KPIs, revenue chart, status breakdown, category pie, satisfaction radial, geo activity map, tech performance table, recent activity), customers/technicians/jobs/payments/reviews tables, disputes queue, editable categories, verification queue, platform settings
- Fixed payment route (derive payer from invoice), messages route (fromUserId), added technician chat view, resolved all lint errors (setState-in-effect, empty-object-types)

Stage Summary:
- Lint: 0 errors, 0 warnings. Dev server clean (all 200s, no runtime errors).
- Agent Browser verified end-to-end lifecycle across all 3 roles:
  * Customer: request → match → technician profile → request → tracking → estimate ready → pay $143.88 → service complete → submit review ✓
  * Technician: dashboard → open job → advance status (REPAIRING→WAITING_APPROVAL, auto-invoice) → chat (sent message confirmed in DB) ✓
  * Admin: overview with live charts/tables, technicians table with verification toggles ✓
- Notifications: real lifecycle events (estimate ready, job completed, new message) appear with categories + read/unread ✓
- Mobile responsive verified (390x844); role switcher, nav, hero, cards all adapt ✓
- MEKANIX is a real, extensible product foundation — mock/service layer via typed API client replaceable with production API without UI changes.
